# Merge and Pray 🚀

Welcome to **Merge and Pray** – the official GitHub organization of a passionate group of DCI students learning and building together. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## 👥 Who We Are

We're a team of motivated developers in training at [DCI – Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/), working together to improve our skills, build meaningful projects, and grow into professional software engineers.

> "We don't just commit code – we commit to learning, sharing, and supporting each other."

## 💡 What We Do

Here in this organization, we publish our **team projects**, **code challenges**, and **mini apps** built during our bootcamp journey.

Some of the things you'll find:
- Full-stack apps with React, Node.js & MongoDB
- Backend APIs built with Express & Mongoose
- Frontend experiments with HTML/CSS/JS
- Group coding challenges and pair programming repos
- Explorations into Next.js, authentication, databases, and more!

## 📚 Technologies We Use

- React, Vite, Next.js
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Git, GitHub Projects & Actions
- Tailwind, CSS Modules, Bootstrap
- And more, as we grow 💪

## 📂 Project Structure

Each repository contains its own `README.md` with:
- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Team members
- Learning goals and takeaways

## 🤝 Join Us (if you're in our class)

If you're a fellow DCI student and want to contribute, reach out to one of the members. We're always happy to collaborate and learn together.

## 🙏 Why “Merge and Pray”?

Because sometimes… merging code is an act of faith 😅  
But seriously — we believe that by supporting each other, even tough challenges become learning opportunities.
